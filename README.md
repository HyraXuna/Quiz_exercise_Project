# Quiz_exercise_Project
A little project, where the goal of the exercise was to code a quiz with 3 questions.
This exercise was made on a jupyter notebook with 2 parts:

* The 1st part corresponds to the quiz with a simple and basic code.

* The 2nd part corresponds to the DRY code, more complexe and efficient if we want to change or add questions and answers. It uses a class and function.
